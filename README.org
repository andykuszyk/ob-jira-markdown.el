* ob-jira-markdown
** About
This package provides a major mode, ~jira-markdown~, which can be with ~ob-jira-markdown~ to create and edit Jira issues. The ~jira-markdown~ mode identifies a buffer's contents as containing markup for a Jira issue, although the mode itself simply derives from ~markdown-mode~.

Source blocks of the ~jira-markdown~ type can then be used to create and edit Jira issues via org-babel's source block execution functionality.
** Status
This package is an early draft, and should be considered to be alpha quality; feel free to use it, but it is subject to change! ðŸ˜…
** Installation
This package is not yet on MELPA, but can be installed locally with:
#+begin_src elisp

  :ensure t
  :load-path "/path/to/ob-jira-markdown.el/"
  :custom
  (ob-jira-markdown-host "https://your-org.atlassian.net"))
#+end_src
** Usage
*** Creating Jira issues
Jira issues can be created directly from ~jira-markdown~ source blocks by executing them as follows:

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_src jira-markdown :command create :execute cli :title test issue
# hello world
this is a test
,#+end_src
#+end_src

In this example, a new issue is created with the title "test issue", and the contents of the source block.

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_src jira-markdown :command edit :execute cli :title test issue :issue abc-123
# hello world
this is a test

The custom variable ~ob-jira-markdown-host~ must be set to the address of your Jira installation for this to work correctly.
