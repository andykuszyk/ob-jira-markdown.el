* ob-jira-markdown.el
** About
This package provides a major mode, ~jira-markdown~, which can be with ~ob-jira-markdown~ to create and edit Jira issues. The ~jira-markdown~ mode identifies a buffer's contents as containing markup for a Jira issue, although the mode itself simply derives from ~markdown-mode~.

Source blocks of the ~jira-markdown~ type can then be used to create and edit Jira issues via org-babel's source block execution functionality.
** Status
This package is an early draft, and should be considered to be alpha quality; feel free to use it, but it is subject to change! üòÖ
** Installation
This package is not yet on MELPA, but can be installed locally with:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package ob-jira-markdown
  :ensure t
  :load-path "/path/to/ob-jira-markdown.el/"
  :custom
  (ob-jira-markdown-host "https://your-org.atlassian.net")
  :bind (("C-x j o" . ob-jira-markdown-open-in-browser)
	 ("C-x j w" . ob-jira-markdown-kill-issue)))
#+end_src
The variable ~ob-jira-markdown-host~ can be customised to make enable opening the issue for source blocks in a browser, but isn't required for the main functionality of ~ob-jira-markdown~.
** Requirements
This package relies on [[https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli][jira-cli]] to communicate with Jira. You should ensure that you have [[https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#installation][installed]] and [[https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started][configured]] it, before attempting to use ~ob-jira-markdown~.
** Usage
*** Creating Jira issues
Jira issues can be created directly from ~jira-markdown~ source blocks by executing them as follows:

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_src jira-markdown :command create :execute cli :title test issue
# hello world
this is a test
,#+end_src
#+end_src

In this example, a new issue is created with the title "test issue", and the contents of the source block.
*** Editing Jira issues
Issues can be edited as follows:

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_src jira-markdown :command edit :execute cli :title test issue :issue abc-123
# hello world
this is a test
,#+end_src
#+end_src
*** Header arguments
The following header arguments are supported:

- :command :: Controls whether issues are created or edited. Valid values are ~create~ and ~edit~.
- :execute :: Controls whether the Jira CLI command should be executed, or outputted as a script. Valid values are ~cli~ to execute the command, and ~script~ to output the script. Use ~script~ if you want to preview the CLI command before executing it with ~cli~.
- :title :: The title of the Jira issue.
- :issue :: The issue key of the issue. Required for ~:command edit~, and must be omitted for ~:command create~.
- :parent :: Optionally, the key of the issue to use as the parent issue.
- :project :: Optionally, the non-default project to create the issue in.
- :type :: They type of issue to create, e.g. ~Story~.
*** Opening issues in a browser
If point is on a source block that has the ~:issue~ header argument set, the command ~ob-jira-markdown-open-in-browser~ can be used interactively to open the issue in a web browser. The custom variable ~ob-jira-markdown-host~ must be set to the address of your Jira installation for this to work correctly.
*** Killing the issue reference of the current source block
A useful command is included in this package to add the issue reference of the source block at point to the kill ring: ~ob-jira-markdown-kill-issue~.
