* ob-jira-markdown
** About
This package provides a major mode, ~jira-markdown~, which can be with ~ob-jira-markdown~ to create and edit Jira issues. The ~jira-markdown~ mode identifies a buffer's contents as containing markup for a Jira issue, although the mode itself simply derives from ~markdown-mode~.

Source blocks of the ~jira-markdown~ type can then be used to create and edit Jira issues via org-babel's source block execution functionality.
** Status
This package is an early draft, and should be considered to be alpha quality; feel free to use it, but it is subject to change! ðŸ˜…
** Usage
*** Creating Jira issues
Jira issues can be created directly from ~jira-markdown~ source blocks by executing them as follows:

#+begin_src jira-markdown :command create :execute cli :title test issue
# hello world
this is a test
#+end_src

In this example, a new issue is created with the title "test issue", and the contents of the source block.
*** Editing Jira issues
Issues can be edited as follows:

#+begin_src jira-markdown :command edit :execute cli :title test issue :issue abc-123
# hello world
this is a test
#+end_src
